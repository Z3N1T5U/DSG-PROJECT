# DSG-PROJECT
**ABSTRACT:**<br>
In this project i tried making a song recommender system based on facial-emotion-recognition which will first capture your facial emotion in real time using webcam and will produce your EMOTION as the output which will be fed as an input in the recommender system which will use spotify api and recommender you songs based on your emotions 
<br>
<br>
**METHODOLOGY:**<br>
For the facial recognisation,I learnt about CNN and used some pretrained models which was not giving enought accuracy, so i tried making my own model creating layers and tried different combination of layers and finally selected one which gave satisfactory accuracy.<br>
Then for the song recommender system i used spotify api but was not able to put it in use.For the recommender system i learnt about KNN,randomforest and decision tree.
<br>
<br>
**Tech Stack Used:**<br>
1.tensorflow<br>
2.scikit-learn<br>
3.opencv<br>
4.pandas<br>
5.numpy<br>
6.matplotlib<br>
7.keras<br>
8.spotipy<br>
9.json<br>
<br>
<br>
It was very difficult to find the perfect model for the best accuracy and it took so... much time for epochs to run a single time and the dataset was very big which took very much time.<br>
